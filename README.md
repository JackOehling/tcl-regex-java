# TCL/HSRE RegEx in Java #

## Introduction ##

This repository contains a port of the TCL Regular Expression (TCLRE) library to Java. The TCL Regular Expression library 
was derived from the Henry Spencer regular expression library.

TCLRE combines a rich, extended, regular expression language with bounded runtime. The bounded runtime is the most important
advantage over the regular expression classes provided in Java, which can run indefinitely.
